<Aside type='note'>
  Before starting use Masonry Grid, make sure to read the [prerequisites guide](../guides/prerequisites) to set up necessary CSS styles for the container and items.

## MasonryGrid

Standard masonry layout that stacks items by pulling them up to fill gaps.

```ts
import { MasonryGrid } from '@masonry-grid/vanilla'

const grid = new MasonryGrid(container)
```

## BalancedMasonryGrid

Balanced masonry layout that reorders items inside rows to minimize overall grid height.

```ts
import { BalancedMasonryGrid } from '@masonry-grid/vanilla'

const grid = new BalancedMasonryGrid(container)
```

## `#destroy()`

Both `MasonryGrid` and `BalancedMasonryGrid` have `destroy()` method that destroys the grid instance and cleans up all observers and styles.

```ts
grid.destroy()
```
